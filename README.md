# IMAP Mini MCP

![Made with AI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-AI-333333?labelColor=f00) ![Verified by Humans](https://img.shields.io/badge/Verified%20by-Humans-333333?labelColor=brightgreen)

A lightweight MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for reading IMAP email and creating draft replies. Works with any standard IMAP server (Gmail, Outlook, Fastmail, etc.) and local bridges like [ProtonMail Bridge](https://proton.me/mail/bridge).

Agents can read, search, move, star, and organize emails, and compose drafts — but cannot send or delete emails.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for recently added features.

## Workflow Recommendation

I highly recommend using a speech-to-text tool (e.g. [SuperWhisper](https://superwhisper.com) on Mac or [Whisperflow](https://whisperflow.com) on Windows) and connecting your AI desktop application (Claude, Codex, etc.) to this MCP server. That way you can converse with your email inbox using speech, which will dramatically speed up your workflow.

## HTTP transport

The server speaks stdio by default, which is what a local MCP client expects.
Set `MCP_TRANSPORT=http` to serve the same tools over the network instead:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | `http` switches the transport |
| `MCP_HTTP_PORT` | `3000` | port to listen on |
| `MCP_HTTP_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | address to bind |

Requests go to `POST /mcp` and are **stateless**: every request gets its own
server and transport, so there is no session to resume and `GET`/`DELETE`
answer `405`. `GET /healthz` is there for a container probe.

The server carries no authentication of its own. Put it somewhere only its
client can reach — a network policy, a private network, or a proxy that
authenticates for it.

## Secrets from a file

`IMAP_PASS_FILE` names a file to read the password from, and takes precedence
over `IMAP_PASS`. A trailing newline is stripped, an empty file is refused, and
an unreadable one is an error rather than a silent fall back to the variable.

Prefer it wherever the platform can mount a secret: a file is not exposed by
`/proc/<pid>/environ`, a crash dump, or an environment a child process inherits.

## Several mailboxes

One process serves one mailbox. For several, run one instance per account —
each with only its own credential, which keeps a compromised instance confined
to a single mailbox.

`IMAP_LABEL` names the mailbox an instance serves. The label travels in the
server name and in the instructions a client receives on `initialize`, so a
client that reached several of them can tell which is which.

## Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -e IMAP_HOST=posteo.de -e IMAP_PORT=993 -e IMAP_SECURE=true \
  -e IMAP_USER=you@example.com -e IMAP_LABEL=Private \
  -e IMAP_PASS_FILE=/run/secrets/imap-pass \
  -v /path/to/app-password:/run/secrets/imap-pass:ro \
  ghcr.io/p3l1/imap-mini-mcp:latest
```

The image defaults to the HTTP transport and runs as a non-root user. It is
built for `linux/arm64` and `linux/amd64`.

## How to Use

### Agent configuration

Add to your MCP client config (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imap-mini-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/imap-mini-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "IMAP_HOST": "imap.example.com",
        "IMAP_USER": "you@example.com",
        "IMAP_PASS": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `args` path must point to the built `dist/index.js`. Add any optional variables to the `env` block as needed.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IMAP_HOST` | yes | — | IMAP server hostname (e.g. `imap.gmail.com`) |
| `IMAP_USER` | yes | — | Email address or username |
| `IMAP_PASS` | yes* | — | Password or app-specific password |
| `IMAP_PASS_FILE` | yes* | — | File to read the password from; wins over `IMAP_PASS` |
| `IMAP_LABEL` | no | — | Names the mailbox this instance serves |
| `IMAP_PORT` | no | `993` | IMAP server port |
| `IMAP_SECURE` | no | `true` | Use TLS for the connection |
| `IMAP_STARTTLS` | no | `true` | Upgrade to TLS via STARTTLS (when `IMAP_SECURE=false`) |
| `IMAP_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` | no | `true` | Reject self-signed TLS certificates |

\* One of `IMAP_PASS` or `IMAP_PASS_FILE` is required.

For most providers (Gmail, Outlook, Fastmail), the defaults work — just set host, user, and password.

For **ProtonMail Bridge** — all five settings below are required (the bridge listens on localhost without TLS, uses a self-signed certificate, and does not support STARTTLS):

```
IMAP_HOST=127.0.0.1
IMAP_PORT=1143
IMAP_SECURE=false
IMAP_STARTTLS=false
IMAP_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false
```

Or as MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imap-mini-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/imap-mini-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "IMAP_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "IMAP_PORT": "1143",
        "IMAP_SECURE": "false",
        "IMAP_STARTTLS": "false",
        "IMAP_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "false",
        "IMAP_USER": "you@proton.me",
        "IMAP_PASS": "your-bridge-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

Every email is identified by a composite **id** (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.<Message-ID>`) that is globally unique and stable across folder moves. Use the `id` returned by `find_emails` to fetch content, download attachments, move emails, or create reply drafts. Action tools accept an optional `mailbox` hint for faster lookup; if omitted, all folders are searched.

### `find_emails`

Search and filter emails. All parameters are optional — calling with no parameters returns all emails from INBOX, sorted newest-first.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `after` | string | — | Only emails after this time. Relative (`"30m"`, `"2h"`, `"7d"`) or ISO date (`"2026-02-20"`) |
| `before` | string | — | Only emails before this time. Same formats as `after` |
| `from` | string | — | Substring match on sender address (e.g. `"alice@example.com"`, `"@stripe.com"`) |
| `subject` | string | — | Substring match on subject line |
| `unread_only` | boolean | `false` | Only return unread emails |
| `has_attachment` | boolean | `false` | Only return emails with attachments |
| `folder` | string | `"INBOX"` | Folder to search |
| `limit` | number | — | Maximum number of results (newest first) |

**Examples:**

| Use case | Parameters |
|---|---|
| Last 24 hours | `{after: "24h"}` |
| Last 7 days, max 10 | `{after: "7d", limit: 10}` |
| Unread emails | `{unread_only: true}` |
| From a domain | `{from: "@stripe.com"}` |
| With attachments, last month | `{after: "30d", has_attachment: true}` |
| Specific sender, in Sent folder | `{from: "alice@example.com", folder: "Sent"}` |

### Other tools

| Tool | Description | Key parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `list_starred_emails` | Starred emails across all folders | — |
| `fetch_email_content` | Full email content by id | `id`, `mailbox?` |
| `fetch_email_attachment` | Download an attachment | `id`, `attachment_id`, `mailbox?` |
| `list_folders` | List all folders | — |
| `create_folder` | Create a new folder | `path` |
| `move_email` | Move an email to another folder | `id`, `destination_folder`, `source_folder?` |
| `bulk_move_by_sender_email` | Move all emails from a sender | `sender`, `source_folder`, `destination_folder` |
| `bulk_move_by_sender_domain` | Move all emails from a domain | `domain`, `source_folder`, `destination_folder` |
| `star_email` | Star an email | `id`, `mailbox?` |
| `unstar_email` | Unstar an email | `id`, `mailbox?` |
| `mark_read` | Mark an email as read | `id`, `mailbox?` |
| `mark_unread` | Mark an email as unread | `id`, `mailbox?` |
| `create_draft` | Create a new draft | `to`, `subject`, `body`, `cc?`, `bcc?`, `in_reply_to?` |
| `draft_reply` | Create a reply draft from an existing email | `id`, `body`, `reply_all?`, `mailbox?` |
| `update_draft` | Replace an existing draft (Drafts folder only) | `id`, `to`, `subject`, `body`, `cc?`, `bcc?`, `in_reply_to?` |

## Troubleshooting

### "IMAP connection closed unexpectedly" or "Server disconnected"

This almost always means the server rejected the connection due to a TLS/STARTTLS mismatch. Verify these environment variables are set correctly in your MCP client config:

| Variable | Check |
|---|---|
| `IMAP_HOST` | Correct hostname or IP |
| `IMAP_PORT` | Matches your server (993 for TLS, 143/1143 for plain) |
| `IMAP_SECURE` | `true` for port 993, `false` for plain connections |
| `IMAP_STARTTLS` | `false` if your server does not support STARTTLS |
| `IMAP_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` | `false` if your server uses a self-signed certificate |

Local IMAP bridges (e.g. ProtonMail Bridge) typically require `IMAP_SECURE=false`, `IMAP_STARTTLS=false`, and `IMAP_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false`. See the ProtonMail Bridge config example in the [Environment variables](#environment-variables) section above.

### "IMAP authentication failed"

Check that `IMAP_USER` and `IMAP_PASS` are correct. Some providers (e.g. Gmail) require an app-specific password rather than your account password.

### "Cannot reach IMAP server — connection refused"

The IMAP server is not running or not listening on the configured host and port. For local bridges, make sure the bridge application is running.

## Development

### Build and run

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Local development with `.env`

For running the server directly (outside of an MCP client), copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials, then:

```bash
npm start
```

When used through an MCP client, credentials are provided via the client config's `env` block instead.

### Testing

Tests use [vitest](https://vitest.dev) and mock the IMAP layer — no real server connection is needed:

```bash
npm test             # run once
npm run test:watch   # watch mode
npm run lint         # type-check only
```
